## 火星气候与天气



在进行行星生态改造前，火星的天气一直不是特别好，沙尘暴特别严重。

火星轨道的偏心率是 0.09，要比地球轨道的偏心率的 0.02 大得多。这导致火星的气候的更加复杂。


### 火星沙尘暴

A=Glacial (permanent ice cap); B=Polar (covered by frost during the winter which sublimates during the summer); C=North (mild) Transitional (Ca) and C South (extreme) Transitional (Cb); D= Tropical; E= Low albedo tropical; F= Subpolar Lowland (Basins); G=Tropical Lowland (Chasmata); H=Subtropical Highland (Mountain).



### 火星天气预报

在移民火星之前，NASA 就开始对火星进行天气预报了：[Mars Weather Reports](http://www.msss.com/msss_images/subject/weather_reports.html).


### 火星气压


火星的原来的气压也比较低，基本上在 1000 Pa 左右，不适合人类居住。

The rover landed at about the time of the annual minimum in atmospheric pressure and documented a seasonal climb to a pressure peak. The maximum and minimum pressures for each Martian day, or sol, from mid-August 2012 to late February 2013 are plotted. Pressure is designated in pascals. For comparison, 1,000 pascals is about one percent of sea-level atmospheric pressure on Earth.
The start of the curve is late winter in Mars' southern hemisphere. The end of the curve is at the end of southern spring. The overall increase is the signature of the entire Martian atmosphere growing in mass through the southern-hemisphere spring. This happens because the south pole receives more and more sunlight, and carbon dioxide vaporizes off of the winter south polar cap. Each year the atmosphere grows and shrinks by about 30 percent due to this effect. The pressure then begins to decline as carbon dioxide freezes out of the atmosphere in the north, forming the winter north polar cap.
